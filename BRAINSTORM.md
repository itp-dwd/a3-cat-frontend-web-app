# Brainstorm

API's I'm thinking about using:
- Genrenator: Feel inspired, get creative constraints
- Genrenator: Every genre but gay, use rita.js to do analysis?
- Genrenator: The stories are so funny! Date topic ideas? "I'm really into destroy celtic dubstep right now."
- Can't pull random lyrics together :/ what else could I do? Other free text? Project gutenburg? Wikipedia? 
- Combine marijuana stain effects with music genres.
  - save to local storage?
- Genre + GPT-2


- Change color of background based on positive or negative, but obviously within a color palette for both.
