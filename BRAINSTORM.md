# Brainstorm

API's I'm thinking about using:
- Genrenator: Feel inspired, get creative constraints
- Genrenator: Every genre but gay, use rita.js to do analysis?
- Genrenator: The stories are so funny! Date topic ideas? "I'm really into destroy celtic dubstep right now."
- Can't pull random lyrics together :/ what else could I do? Other free text? Project gutenburg? Wikipedia? 
- Combine marijuana stain effects with music genres.
  - save to local storage?
- Genre + GPT-2

You haven't heard of death mandolino? It's the strangest and most elegant way to screw up a vacation.

Death mandolinino is a style of art exhibited by cellists that involves hanging oneself on a mandolin while the instrument and strings vibrate.

Unlike most other attempts at suicide, it's not done by the act of directly shooting yourself or someone else. The body is intended to vibrate as if hanging upside down.

Instead, the technique involves positioning the person's body so that it's resting on the mandolin â€“ often suspended over a river or other body of water.

After the person's neck is severed (usually from the underside by something like a horse saddle), he or she lies in a half-submerged position

I'm really into cuban volks poptronica right now. They're amazing.

What I wasn't happy with was their attention to commercialism. For the most part, Cuban Volks's music reflects the retro-futurist future of today; cool tech, faux-metal, and synths. Sometimes, though, it seems like they took every word out of pop's Official Crossover Song Contest and packaged it into one banger.

Overall, this track is pretty uninspired; I felt it lacked atmosphere or strength of a song.
